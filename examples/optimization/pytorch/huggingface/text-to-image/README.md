# Stable Diffusion

The script ```run_diffusion.py``` is based on [huggingface/diffusers](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/tree/main/examples/text_to_image) and provides post-training static quantization approach based on IntelÂ® Neural Compressor.


## Requirements
 The dataset [pokemon-blip-captions](https://huggingface.co/datasets/lambdalabs/pokemon-blip-captions) and metric FID from ```pyotrch_fid``` is used for the work. the [picture](https://datasets-server.huggingface.co/assets/lambdalabs/pokemon-blip-captions/--/lambdalabs--pokemon-blip-captions/train/14/image/image.jpg) in folder ```base_images``` is used in the following example.
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Quantization
```bash
python run_diffusion.py \
    --model_name_or_path lambdalabs/sd-pokemon-diffusers \
    --tune \
    --quantization_approach PostTrainingStatic \
    --perf_tol 0.02 \
    --output_dir /tmp/diffusion_output \
    --base_images base_images \
    --input_text "a drawing of a gray and black dragon" \
    --calib_text "a drawing of a green pokemon with red eyes"
```


The ground truth image:

<div align="left">
<img src=images/ground_truth.png width=40%/>
</div>

The image generated by original model(FID with ground truth: 333):

<div align="left">
<img src=images/fp32.png width=40%/>
</div>

The image generated by quantized UNet(FID with ground truth: 246):

<div align="left">
<img src=images/int8.png width=40%/>
</div>

## Performance
Original model
```bash
python run_diffusion.py \
    --model_name_or_path lambdalabs/sd-pokemon-diffusers \
    --output_dir /tmp/diffusion_output \
    --base_images base_images \
    --input_text "a drawing of a gray and black dragon" \
    --benchmark
```
The model of quantized UNet
```bash
python run_diffusion.py \
    --model_name_or_path lambdalabs/sd-pokemon-diffusers \
    --output_dir /tmp/diffusion_output \
    --base_images base_images \
    --input_text "a drawing of a gray and black dragon" \
    --benchmark \
    --int8
```
