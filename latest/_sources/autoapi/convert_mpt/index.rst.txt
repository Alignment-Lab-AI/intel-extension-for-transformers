   convert_mpt.bytes_to_unicode



.. py:function:: bytes_to_unicode()

   Returns list of utf-8 byte and a corresponding list of unicode strings.
   The reversible bpe codes work on unicode strings.
   This means you need a large # of unicode characters in your vocab if you want to avoid UNKs.
   When you're at something like a 10B token dataset you end up needing around 5K for decent coverage.
   This is a signficant percentage of your normal, say, 32K bpe vocab.
   To avoid that, we want lookup tables between utf-8 bytes and unicode strings.
   And avoids mapping to whitespace/control characters the bpe code barfs on.
