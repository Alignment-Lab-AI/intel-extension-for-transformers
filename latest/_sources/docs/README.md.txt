# Docs of overview and installation
These documents provide a detailed description of the functionalities of Intel Extension for Transformers.
[architecture.html](architecture.html) offers an overview of Intel Extension for Transformers, encompassing various architectural levels.

You can fine install guidelines in [installation.html](installation.html).

# Docs of optimization and inference

Optimization docs: [quantization.html](quantization.html), [pruning.html](pruning.html), [autodistillation.html](autodistillation.html), [distillation.html](distillation.html), 

[export.html](export.html) provides PyTorch to onnx including int8 model.

[get_started.html](get_started.html) guides you to use optimization API and sparse inference. Comprehensive API guidance is available in [API doc](https://intel.github.io/intel-extension-for-transformers/latest/docs/Welcome.html), generated using [api_doc](api_doc) and [build_docs](build_docs). You may disregard the two mentioned folders. 

We also provide examples in [examples.html](examples.html). P.S, smoothquant, weight-only quantization and cpp inference are not in these documents. SmoothQuant: [smoothquant.html](smoothquant.html), weight-only quantization: [weightonlyquant.html](weightonlyquant.html).

[tutorials/pytorch/](tutorials/pytorch) provides tutorials of many tasks.

# Docs of other functionalities

These utils may help you:
[data_augmentation.html](data_augmentation.html) does NLP datasets augmentation.
[benchmark.html](benchmark.html) is used to measure the model performance. 
[metrics.html](metrics.html) defines which metric will be used to measure the model.
To measure the status of the tuning model, you can refer to [objectives.html](objectives.html).
[pipeline.html](pipeline.html) makes it simple to use any model from the Hub for inference on tasks.
