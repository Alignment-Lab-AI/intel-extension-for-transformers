# Design of AVX512F Kernel

## Key Instruction
In this kernel, we use the `vfmadd` instruction from AVX512F for matrix multiplication. Specifically, `vfmadd231ps` does the following:
```
FOR j := 0 to 15
	i := j*32
	dst[i+31:i] := (a[i+31:i] * b[i+31:i]) + dst[i+31:i]
ENDFOR
dst[MAX:512] := 0
```

## Sparse Pattern & Data Format
Based on `vfmadd231ps`, the sparse pattern is set to 1 x 16, where 1 is the degree of reduction and 16 is the degree of the parallelization. In terms of neural network, 1 for input channel and 16 is for output channel. Therefore, for each `vfmadd231ps`, 1 element of activation is broadcasted 16 times and 16 contingent elements of weight are loaded as its operands.

Given the sparse pattern, Block Compressed Column format (a column variant of [BSR](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.sparse.bsr_matrix.html)) is adopted to optimize memory access so that non-zero elements of weight are accessed sequentially along K-dimension.

## Loops
1. We first iterate blocks over the m-dimension, which is the dimension of batch size.

2. (Not implemented) Similar to the top-level loop, n-dimension is divided into blocks and iterated through. This blocking may bring enhancement as it reduces the size of assembly code for each iteration thus relief frontend bottleneck.

The above 2 levels of loop are C++ loops and their iterations can be parallelly executed on multiple cores with the help of OpenMP.

3. The m-blocks created in loop 1 are further divided into the m-blocks of microkernels. We unroll `vfmadd231ps` and its peripheral a few times (within the limit of available vector registers) to improve the performance. Currently it is unrolled 4 times to form a 4 * K * 16 micro kernel (see the graph below). It is promising to make it configurable to find or dynamically decide the optimal size of microkernel.

4. The n-blocks in loop 2 (or the whole output channel) are iterated by blocks of 16, which matches the width of ZMM registers when handling fp32.

The above 2 levels of loop are assembly loop in JIT objects.

5. The k-dimension of microkernel are implemented as C++ JIT loop that generates a sequence of operations with the information of the sparse structure.

6. The m-loop of microkernel is described in loop 3 and is implemented as unrolled assembly code.

7. The n-loop of microkernel is implicit as the parallelism of SIMD instructions.

The last 3 levels of loop are inside the microkernel.
